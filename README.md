## Notes for instructor
*Thank you for the extension.  My mom was admitted to the hospital when I just finished watching all the lectures and I thought I could just do the project in less than a day, however, when I came back after little more than a week of absent, I have completely forgoten everything and had to rewatch the videos to do the project.  Barely finished on time I promised and barely worked on the style with css.*
