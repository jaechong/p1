    <p>My name is Jae Chong.  I have worked in the personal computer industry as a software engineer for more than 35 years and have recently retired.</p>  
    <p>I had too many things to do when I retired. Drawing, painting, cartooning, woodworking, pottery making and etc have been my passion since in my childhood. I was keen to learn new things like playing piano, guitar, and saxophone. I also looked forward to play squash, badminton, table tennis, and soccer without having to rush back to work. To make my retirement more meaningful, I was eager to do lots of community volunteering work. After making myself busy enjoying all the things mentioned above for about 6 months, I just felt I should contribute more to the society with the skills that I have while I am still young.</p>
    <p>I took CSCI E3 and E12, and now I am taking CSCI E15 and E31 this term at HES.  I hope to learn both front and back end of the web development and hopely to help some charity organizations and friends.  I spent most of my career working on the low system level programming so it is really nice to explore in this high level programming world.  I always thought programming was my job but I am realizing how fun it is to program after more than 35 years of programming.</p>
